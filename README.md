Network Managment Database to Track Data Drops by Building

This is a basic web-application which connects a PHP-based website to a MySQL database containing information about the data and voice drops within a building.  Designed specifically for use in buildings that have more than one server rack (even in different rooms) and using VLANs.  Will also track voice drops.

Searches available include:
1.) Search By Data Drop Number
2.) Search Data Drops by Room
3.) Search Data Drops by Switch
4.) Search Data Drops by Rack
5.) Search Data Drops by Port Number
6.) Search Data Drops by VLAN

Also, users can insert, update and delete drops from within the GUI.
